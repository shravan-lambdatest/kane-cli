# Kane CLI — `kane-cli testrun` + evidence steering

Load this file when the user wants to run **several** saved `_test.md` tests as one batch ("run the suite", "run all the smoke tests", "nightly regression"), or asks about **evidence packs** (viewing, sharing, validating a run's `.evidence` file).

`kane-cli testrun run` executes many **authored** `_test.md` files as one execution: one summary, one exit code, one sealed evidence pack for the whole suite.

# When to use testrun

- The user has **two or more saved `_test.md` tests** to run → `kane-cli testrun run`. Do NOT hand-roll a bash loop or spawn parallel `testmd run` processes — testrun does isolation, pooling, and a single rollup for you.
- One test → `kane-cli testmd run` (load `kane-cli-testmd.md`).
- Multiple ad-hoc `run` objectives (not saved tests) → the parallel-execution section of `kane-cli-run.md` still applies.
- **Mobile** `_test.md` members (`target: emulator|simulator`) are normal members (0.8.7+): locally on mac-arm64 with `--device-name`/`--os-version`; on the **cloud grid from any machine** with `--remote` (section below and `kane-cli-mobile.md`).
- The user wants the suite on the **cloud grid** (no local Chrome, or a mobile suite from a non-Mac) → `kane-cli testrun run … --remote < /dev/null`.

# Command

```bash
kane-cli testrun run [paths...] [flags] < /dev/null   # NDJSON only when stdin is not a TTY: every line you write ends in < /dev/null — there is NO --agent flag on testrun
```

`[paths...]` is optional — omit it to auto-discover every `*_test.md` under the cwd. Explicit paths must end in `_test.md`.

| Flag | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--match <regex>` | Filter candidates by project-relative path regex | The path is as the OS writes it: `tests/app/` on macOS and Linux, `tests\app\` on Windows. Quote the regex with double quotes in cmd.exe; single quotes are literal there. |
| `--tags <list>` | ANY-match on frontmatter `tags:` (repeatable or comma-separated, case-insensitive) | — |
| `--parallel <n>` | Worker count; each desktop worker gets an isolated Chrome with a fresh temp profile | `1` |
| `--on-failure <mode>` | `continue` (run everything) \| `fail-fast` (stop dispatching new members after a failure) | `continue` |
| `--name <label>` | Run title in the dashboard | derived |
| `--dry-run` | Print the plan (members + preflight failures) and exit; runs nothing | off |
| `--no-adaptive-heal` | Disable default adaptive healing after replay failure | healing enabled |
| `--bug-detection <mode>` | `off`\|`stop`\|`continue`, passed through to authoring members | config (`off`) |
| `--headless` | Headless Chrome — use in CI | off |
| `--remote [backend]` | Dispatch the suite to the HyperExecute grid (default backend `hyper`); needs `kane-cli plugin install remote-execution` — see "Remote" below | off |
| `--device-name <name>` | Device for the mobile members: as `kane-cli devices list --target <kind>` prints it locally, or a grid catalog device (`devices list … --remote`) with `--remote` | members' `device_name:` |
| `--os-version <version>` | OS version for the mobile members (`14`, `17.5`); alone = any device on that version | members' `os_version:` |
| `--username` / `--access-key` | Basic auth | active profile |

# Preflight (why members get rejected)

All members must share one org + project. *(0.8.4+)* Members need **not** be authored — an unauthored member classifies as `author`: the run authors it in the author pass, and the evidence consolidates afterwards (best-effort). On pre-0.8.4 CLIs the same members refuse (`missing_meta` / `not_authored` — remedy: author once with `kane-cli testmd run`). Failure reasons on the plan:

| Reason | Plain-language meaning | What to tell the user |
|---|---|---|
| `org_mismatch` | Different organisation than the other tests | "Check `kane-cli testmd status <path>` — it belongs to another org" |
| `project_mismatch` | Different project than the other tests | "Run it separately or per-project" |

If **any** member fails preflight, the plan is invalid: nothing runs, exit `2`. Suggest `--dry-run` to preview the plan cheaply before a big run. *(0.8.15+)* Preflight also checks variables. A `{{name}}` with no value is a warning: the member stays in the plan (`valid` does not look at variables), and the run types the name as written unless a step sets it first. The check covers every step of the member, replayed ones included. `testrun run` has no `--variables` flag, so fill the pool file (`.testmuai/variables/*.json`) or the member's own `variables:` frontmatter first, per **Fill the variables before any run** in the `kane-cli-run` steering file.

# Remote: the suite as one HyperExecute job (`--remote`)

`kane-cli testrun run <selection> --remote < /dev/null` ships the cwd as the job payload, provisions a grid runtime on a **HyperExecute macOS runner** — Chrome for web members, a **virtual Android emulator or iOS simulator** for mobile members — runs every member there as its own headless `testmd run`, and brings the recordings (`output-<stem>/`) and the sealed evidence pack back into the project. Works **from any machine** with nothing local but Node and the plugin (no Chrome needed); the account needs a HyperExecute plan with macOS runners and the plugin (`kane-cli plugin install remote-execution`; `kane-cli plugin doctor remote-execution` checks it). Auth is a LambdaTest username + access key — an OAuth profile is exchanged automatically. Not the same as `--ws-endpoint`, which attaches a remote browser to a run that still executes locally.

```bash
kane-cli testrun run --tags smoke --remote --dry-run < /dev/null                            # validate + resolve, dispatch nothing
kane-cli testrun run --match '^tests/app/' --remote --device-name "Pixel 7" --os-version 14 < /dev/null   # Android suite on the grid
kane-cli testrun run --match '^tests/ios/' --remote --device-name "iPhone 15" --os-version 17.5 < /dev/null   # iOS suite on the grid
```

- **Always `--dry-run` first** — it runs the remote preflight and resolves the device against the grid catalog (`kane-cli devices list --target emulator|simulator --remote --agent`) without creating a job.
- **`--parallel N`** becomes the job's concurrency for web and device suites alike (members auto-split across N grid tasks; a device task gets its own VM and device). **Web suites**: `--headless` is unnecessary; no `remote_device` event. Overhead ~15 s of setup plus the tests' own time (a mobile job adds a minute or more for device boot).
- **One job = one runtime**: a selection mixing web and device members, emulator and simulator members, or emulator members on several Android versions is refused with a split suggestion. Simulator members may differ in iOS version as long as they land on one HyperExecute pool (`mobile_pool_split` otherwise).
- **Mobile app on the grid**: a member's local build (`.apk` for emulator, `.zip` for simulator, anywhere on disk) is uploaded from the laptop at preflight and handed to the grid as `--app <id>` (one `remote_app` event per distinct build); an `APP…` id is used as-is. Nothing has to be inside the project or un-gitignored; `--dry-run` uploads nothing. Details in `kane-cli-mobile.md`.
- Grid member flags include `--author` and `--no-adaptive-heal`. `--name` labels suite metadata.

Remote preflight refusals arrive as one `remote_error` per reason (then `testrun_done` failed, exit 2): `mobile_remote_mixed`, `mobile_remote_mixed_platform`, `mobile_os_version_split`, `mobile_pool_split`, `mobile_remote_unsupported`, `mobile_app_missing`, `mobile_app_not_uploadable`, `mobile_app_upload_failed`, `member_outside_payload`, `gitignored_inputs`, `on_grid`, `invalid_plan`, `project_authority_conflict` — each `detail` names the paths and the fix; relay it in plain language.

Extra events with `--remote` (stdout, typed): `remote_start {backend, env}` → `remote_device {platform, slug, name, os_version, avd_id?, pool?}` (present as the device line) → `remote_device_hint {reason, detail}` (informational; `device_name_ignored` is emulator-only) → `remote_app {path, app_id, source: uploaded|cache|dry-run}` (one per distinct local build uploaded from the laptop) → `remote_dispatched {job_id, job_url}` (give the user the link) → the normal `testrun_*` stream → `remote_done {status, exit, job_id, sessions_path}`. `testrun_summary` carries `remote: {backend, jobId, jobUrl, sessionsPath}`. A member `broken` with `execution: null` means the grid-side run refused before launching — send the user to `job_url` for the scenario log.

# NDJSON events

All typed; stdout; one JSON object per line. **Local completion: `testrun_done`; with `--remote`, read through `remote_done` and process exit** (there is no `run_end` at the testrun level).

| `type` | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `testrun_plan` | `members: [{path, test_id?, tags, failure?, unresolved?}]`, `valid`, `parallel`, `parallel_clamped?` | If `valid: false`, treat as immediate failure — report each member's `failure` reason and expect exit `2`; a `warning` may still follow before the process exits. *(0.8.15+)* `unresolved[]` lists the member's `{{name}}`s with no value; `valid` does not look at it. One `warning` event with `code: "unresolved_variables"` follows the plan and the run goes ahead. |
| `testrun_start` | `execution_id`, `members` (paths), `parallel` | |
| `testrun_member_start` | `path`, `test_id?`, *(0.8.17+)* `session_id`, `log_path` | A saved test started. `log_path` is the absolute path of that test's own event log (see **Each test's own log** below). |
| `testrun_member_end` | `path`, `test_id?`, `status`, `duration_s`, *(0.8.17+)* `session_id`, `log_path`, `failure?: {message, step_index?}` | `status` ∈ `passed \| failed \| broken \| interrupted`. `failure` is present when the test did not pass: use it for the "where" and "why" of the failed-tests table. |
| `testrun_authored_member_start` / `testrun_authored_member_end` | same fields as the two rows above | A test that had no recording yet is authored in a separate pass after the replays. Treat the end event exactly like `testrun_member_end`. `path` can be relative here and absolute elsewhere: match tests by file name. |
| `testrun_progress` *(0.8.17+)* | `running: [paths]`, `pending`, `done`, `total` | Fires on every test start and end, never on a timer. It counts the replay pass only, so take the suite's size from `testrun_plan.members`, not from `total`. Informational: the rollup still comes from `testrun_summary`. |
| `testrun_investigations_wait` | `count` | Failed replays left investigations running; the coordinator waits before sealing. Narrate as "investigating N failures". |
| `testrun_evidence_ingest` | `status: "ok"\|"failed"`, `evidence_id`, `stage?` | Pack published to the dashboard. Absent when publish is skipped. |
| `testrun_summary` | `totals: {tests, passed, failed, broken, skipped, authored}`, `duration_s`, `upload`, `cancelled`, `execution: {id, status}` | Build the rollup from this. |
| `testrun_done` | `execution_id`, `overall_status: "passed"\|"failed"\|"cancelled"` | Local completion; remote runs continue through `remote_done`. |

The wait-for-terminal rule from `kane-cli-run.md` applies unchanged — narrate while events stream, act only after `testrun_done` or process exit.

## Each test's own log, and `--stream-members` (0.8.17+)

A suite's stdout stays small on purpose: it reports each test's start and end, not the steps inside it. Every test's full event stream (the same events `testmd run` prints, see the saved-test stream in `kane-cli-testmd.md`) is written to its own log, and the start and end events name it in `log_path`.

- **To diagnose a failed test, read only that test's `log_path`** (and its failure record in the evidence pack). That keeps Kiro's context small.
- **Do not pass `--stream-members` by default.** The flag prints every test's events on the suite's stdout, each wrapped as `{"type":"testrun_member_event","member":{"index","path","test_id?"},"event":{...}}` (`member.index` is the 0-based position in `testrun_plan.members`). On a 12-test suite that is a few hundred lines to read for nothing. Use it only when the user explicitly wants the full stream, for example in a CI log.
- Every line also carries `v` and `ts`, and the first line is `stream_start` (see the stream contract in `kane-cli-run.md`). Ignore fields and event types you do not know.

## Remote additions (0.8.17+)

- `remote_start` also carries `log_path`: the grid client's own log on this machine, useful when a dispatch fails before a job exists.
- `remote_dispatched` arrives as soon as the job exists, not at the end, so the job link can be given to the user early.
- The grid reports per-test detail **after the job ends**: `testrun_start`, then a start and end event per test in plan order, each with `post_hoc: true`, just before `testrun_summary`. Their `ts` is the grid's own time. They carry the same fields as local, including `log_path` and `failure`.
- `testrun_progress` is not emitted on remote.

# Presenting results

Never expose event/field names. Like every session, a suite session starts with the ready check (POWER.md → Every session; add the grid plugin check for `--remote`). After completion and process exit (`remote_done` for dispatched remote runs), render the suite card. The rules for every card in `kane-cli-run.md` (Presenting results) apply here too.

| | |
|-------|-------|
| 🔴 **Suite** | 11 of 12 passed |
| ⏱️ **Duration** | 4m 44s |
| 🧪 **Tests** | 11 passed · 1 failed · 0 broken · 0 skipped |
| 📁 **Evidence** | One pack for the whole suite · want to open it? |
| ➡️ **Next** | I can open the failed test's log and diagnose it · Re-run just that test |

Use 🟢 when every test passed. Then list **only** the tests that did not pass, with where and why from each test's failure detail (0.8.17+):

| ❌ Failed test | Where | Why | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| checkout_test.md | Step 3 | Cart total did not match | 41s |

On kane-cli older than 0.8.17 the end event has no reason: read it from the evidence pack, or leave `Where` and `Why` as `see evidence`.

**Cloud grid runs** add rows after 🧪:

```markdown
| 📱 **Device** | <device name> · <platform and OS version> · cloud grid |
| ☁️ **Grid job** | [Open the job](<job link>) · <build file> uploaded |
```

A test that comes back broken with zero steps on the grid was refused before it launched: say so, point to the job link, and suggest checking that the app id belongs to this account.

An invalid plan is a `🟡 Didn't start` card (see `kane-cli-run.md`) with one line per rejected test.

Don't list passing tests individually. If the pack published, mention the run is visible in the dashboard. To diagnose a failed test, read that test's own log, not the whole suite's output.

# Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | All members passed |
| `1` | At least one member failed or broke |
| `2` | Usage error / invalid plan / auth error — nothing ran |
| `3` | Cancelled (Ctrl-C — in-flight members finish, the pack still seals) |

# Evidence packs

Every Kane CLI run seals an **evidence pack**: one `.evidence` file (a zip) holding the test definition, results, per-step screenshots + annotated screenshots, per-step console/network logs, run logs, and failure records. It is the **only** home of run artifacts — the legacy `runs/<n>/` session subdirectory is no longer created.

**Inside a pack** (a standard zip — `unzip -l` lists it, `unzip -p <pack> <entry>` prints one entry):

```
<execution_id>.evidence
├── run.yaml                          # run manifest: title, status, started/ended, totals
├── failure.yaml                      # run-level failure rollup
└── tests/<test-id>/                  # one per test (testrun packs have many)
    ├── test.md                       # the definition
    ├── result.yaml                   # verdict + steps[] (ordinal, status, kind, duration_ms, action_id)
    ├── logs/                         # meta.yaml, tui.log, and per run index n:
    │                                 #   <n>-run.log, <n>-actions.ndjson,
    │                                 #   <n>-console.ndjson, <n>-network.har
    ├── steps/<ordinal>-<step-id>/    # screenshot.png, annotated.png, step.json
    │                                 #   (+ failure.yaml on failed steps)
    ├── auteur/execution.json         # full execution trajectory
    └── v16-trajectory/               # per-run planning summaries
```

**Where packs land:**

| Surface | Sealed pack location |
|---|---|
| `kane-cli run` | `{session_dir}/evidence/<execution_id>.evidence`; also copied to `<cwd>/.testmuai/evidence/` when the run is named (`--name`) |
| `kane-cli testmd run` | always copied to `<cwd>/.testmuai/evidence/` |
| `kane-cli testrun run` | created directly in `<cwd>/.testmuai/evidence/` (one pack for the whole suite) |

**The stderr hint.** After a successful run, Kane CLI prints one hint line to **stderr** (plain text — never an NDJSON event; don't look for it on stdout):

```
evidence: view locally with `kane-cli evidence serve <packPath>`
```

**Serving a pack.** When the user wants to see run evidence, run `kane-cli evidence serve <pack>` (keep it running in the background) and give the user the `viewer` URL from its stdout:

```
serving 1 pack on http://127.0.0.1:<port>
<name>.evidence
  pack    http://127.0.0.1:<port>/<token>/<name>.evidence
  viewer  https://evidence.lambdatest.com/?pack=<encoded pack url>
press Ctrl-C to stop
```

Present only the `viewer` line as a clickable link. Tell the user the server is local-only — nothing uploads; their browser reads the pack from their machine. Stop the process when they're done.

**Validate** — when a pack won't open (truncated / unsealed / killed run) or as a CI gate:

```bash
kane-cli evidence validate <execution-id-or-path> --json    # exit 0 valid / 1 invalid / 2 not found
```

**Merge** — combine several packs into one (targets are execution ids or paths, order-significant; `--run-id` required):

```bash
kane-cli evidence merge <targets...> --run-id <id>          # exit 0 merged / 1 policy abort / 2 usage
```

**Debugging with a pack:** the failed step's failure record (error + page state), its console/network slice (4xx/5xx or JS errors usually explain the failure), and the annotated screenshot (what the agent actually acted on). Same flow as "Failure handling" in `kane-cli-run.md`.

**Debug escape hatch:** `KANE_TESTRUN_MEMBER_DEBUG=1` surfaces per-member output (stderr, `[member]` prefix).

## Execution constraints

Local suites containing any mobile member require `--parallel 1`; larger values are refused. Isolated Chrome workers apply to desktop members only. Remote suites support grid concurrency via `--parallel N`.

Healing is enabled by default (three shrinking replay windows, then re-authoring of authorable steps). `--no-adaptive-heal` disables it. Retired `--retry`/`--retry-count` only print a notice and have no effect. Replay-only recorded steps retain their recordings even during healing.

NDJSON selection uses stdin, not stdout: every `kane-cli testrun run` line ends in `< /dev/null` (bash and zsh on macOS, Linux and Git Bash; `< NUL` in cmd.exe; from PowerShell run it through cmd: `cmd /c "kane-cli testrun run … < NUL"`). Check the first stdout line: on 0.8.17+ it is `{"type":"stream_start"…}`. A prose plan there instead means the CLI is in terminal mode: it prints the human view and, after a real run, opens an evidence table that waits until `q` or Esc, so the process never exits on its own. Stop it and rerun with the redirect. An empty stdout with a message on stderr is a usage error: read it. Dry-run validates a plan, not runtime authentication or browser/device readiness. Always observe process exit, including paths without a normal completion event.

### Remote behavior still requiring verification

The audited dispatch does not forward `--bug-detection` to member commands and does not map `--on-failure` into the job template. Do not rely on these flags for remote bug-detection or fail-fast behavior until implementation owners confirm or fix the mapping. `--name` is suite metadata, not a forwarded member flag.

For dispatched runs, read through `remote_done` and process exit after `testrun_done`; retain the remote status and session-log path. Preflight refusal and dry-run may terminate without `remote_done`.

## Evidence merge identity

For ordinary runs, default merge identity distinguishes the test and commit (`external_id.test_id`, `external_id.commit_id`) and the environment (`environment.os`, `environment.os_version`, `environment.browser`, `environment.browser_version`). Re-runs with the same identity nest as attempts; a different environment produces a separate sibling.

Explicit collision policies can change grouping; a custom `--rules` file replaces the default rules rather than extending them. Check the selected identity rules before interpreting two runs as retries of the same test.
