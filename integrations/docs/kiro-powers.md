# Updating the Kiro Powers integration

The `integrations/kiro-powers/` folder is a [Kiro power](https://kiro.dev/docs/powers/) for Kane CLI. It is a **translation** of the canonical Kane CLI skill into Kiro's POWER.md + steering-file format. The canonical source is `skill-installer/skills/SKILL.md`. **Every time `SKILL.md` changes, this integration may need to change too.** This document is the update playbook.

## TL;DR

1. Read what changed in `skill-installer/skills/SKILL.md`.
2. Find the corresponding sections in `integrations/kiro-powers/` using the mapping table below.
3. Update those sections, keeping the Kiro-specific framing (frontmatter, steering-file split, "wait for run_end" rule, in-power steering references).
4. Run the verification checklist.
5. Commit.

## Source of truth

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Canonical skill** | `skill-installer/skills/SKILL.md` | Source of every CLI fact: command shapes, flags, exit codes, NDJSON essentials, decision tree, results presentation. **Edit this first.** Every other integration mirrors from here. |
| **Canonical references** | `skill-installer/skills/references/*.md` | On-demand reference content: `ready-check.md` (preflight, the ready card, problems that stop a run, sign-in), `first-run.md` (run first, the verbatim tour, three choices asked once), `agent-config.md` (the saved preferences file: location, schema, shell read and write, hard-case rules), `cards.md` (every result card and the rules for all cards), `live-strip.md` (the Claude Code status bar strip, not offered in Kiro), `objectives-cookbook.md` (pattern catalog + checkpoint analyze methods), `testmd.md` (file format, replay, the saved-test stream), `generate.md` + `generate-parsing.md` (AI test-case authoring), `test-manager.md` (project/folder agent surface, auto-default event, the global "changing where results go" flow), `parsing.md` (full NDJSON schema and the 0.8.17+ stream contract), `debug.md` (log layout), `parallel.md`, `setup-and-config.md`. Equally authoritative: facts in any of these must mirror through. |
| Kiro power root | `integrations/kiro-powers/POWER.md` | Frontmatter (name/displayName/keywords/author), onboarding (install, sign-in rules, project/folder), the **Every session** protocol (ready check commands, ready card, problems table, no-human rule, launch line, watch mode), condensed command reference, steering-file mapping. |
| First session + saved preferences steering | `integrations/kiro-powers/steering/kane-cli-first-run.md` | Loaded on a user's first session, on "kane tour" and on "kane preferences": the run-first rule and its defaults, the first-run tour (verbatim from canonical `first-run.md`), the first result's extra rows, the three choices asked once after the first result, and the saved preferences file (location, schema, shell read and write, hard-case rules; host key `kiro`). |
| `kane-cli run` steering | `integrations/kiro-powers/steering/kane-cli-run.md` | Full reference for one-shot `kane-cli run`: objective patterns + checkpoint analyze methods (Visual / Textual-DOM / URL / Title / DevTools→Network/Console/Performance/Cookies/localStorage), full flag table, NDJSON parsing (including `project_folder_auto_defaulted`), results presentation, failure diagnosis, parallel execution, project/folder management (`projects`/`folders list|create`, auto-default gate). |
| `kane-cli testmd` steering | `integrations/kiro-powers/steering/kane-cli-testmd.md` | Full reference for `kane-cli testmd`: file format, frontmatter (incl. `tags:`), `@import`, replay/author cache, `Result.md`, CI patterns, parse errors, generate → testmd pipeline. |
| `kane-cli testrun` + evidence steering | `integrations/kiro-powers/steering/kane-cli-testrun.md` | Full reference for `kane-cli testrun run` (selection, preflight, parallel, dry-run, typed `testrun_*` NDJSON events, exit codes) and the evidence-pack surface (`evidence serve/validate/merge`, pack locations, the stderr view hint). |
| `kane-cli fair-evaluation` steering | `integrations/kiro-powers/steering/kane-cli-fair-evaluation.md` | How to compare Kane CLI to other approaches honestly: like-for-like lifecycle phases (authoring vs the alternative's script *creation*; replay vs execution; plus locator-break repair + ongoing maintenance), the comparison traps (replay is zero-LLM, the sunk-cost trap, phase mismatch), and what Kane CLI is purpose-built for. |
| `kane-cli mobile` steering | `integrations/kiro-powers/steering/kane-cli-mobile.md` | Full reference for driving a native mobile app (locally on macOS Apple Silicon, or on the cloud grid from any machine): the `--target desktop\|emulator\|simulator` axis (desktop/browser is the default), `--device-name` / `--os-version` / `--app` selection, the required app under test (build or `APP…` id), one-time local setup + `kane-cli doctor` / `devices list`, the flat `_test.md` `target:` + `app:` (+ `device_name:`/`os_version:`) frontmatter keys, mobile members in `testrun` and `testrun run --remote` (grid rules and preflight codes), and the web-only checkpoint carve-out. |
| `kane-cli assurance` steering | `integrations/kiro-powers/steering/kane-cli-assurance.md` | Full reference for the assurance flow: requirement docs → `context ingest`/`extract` → review checkpoints → `design tests` → author → `testrun` → `cover`, the `--mode agent` pause loop (exit 3 = resumable), the review checkpoints, and `maintain reconcile`. |
| Hook template | `integrations/kiro-powers/hooks/kane-verify.kiro.hook` | Sample agent hook the user copies to their workspace `.kiro/hooks/`. |

If a fact appears in this integration that is **not** in `SKILL.md` or one of the `references/*.md`, that's a bug — either backfill the canonical source first, or delete the fact from the integration.

## SKILL.md (+ references) → Kiro Powers mapping

The canonical skill is a thin `SKILL.md` (7 sections, ~300 lines) plus on-demand `references/*.md`. The Kiro power's three steering files absorb the equivalent depth — Kiro reads the right steering file per workflow, the way Claude Code reads the right reference file on demand.

| Canonical source | Where it lives in the Kiro power |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` §1 Every session: ready check, launch, result card (the session order, runtime tagging inline on every command, launch line, watch mode, passed and failed cards, the three choices after a first result). The Monitor/Bash launch decision and the preflight script path are Claude-Code-skill specifics: Kiro keeps its own narration model and runs the fallback commands instead | `POWER.md` → Step 0 (tagging) + Every session (order, ready check, launch line, watch mode) **and** `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Presenting results (launch line, narration, result cards) |
| `references/ready-check.md`: the ready check, the ready card (full table on a first session, one line afterwards, problem version), which problems stop a run, sign-in rules, the no-human rule. **Harness difference:** the canonical skill runs `scripts/preflight.sh`; the Kiro power has no script, so it mirrors the documented fallback (`kane-cli whoami`, `kane-cli balance`, `kane-cli config show`, plus the saved preferences read) and drops the rows only the script can fill (Chrome, running app) | `POWER.md` → Every session (The ready check, The ready card, Problems, No human present) **and** `POWER.md` → Step 2 (sign-in rules) |
| `references/first-run.md`: run first and ask after, detected defaults, first run launched with `--name`, the tour (verbatim), the first payoff's extra rows, three choices asked once | All of `steering/kane-cli-first-run.md` except its Saved preferences section. The app-port proposal is not mirrored (it needs the script's app probe) |
| `references/agent-config.md`: saved preferences location, schema, shell read and write, hard-case rules, changing preferences later | `steering/kane-cli-first-run.md` → Saved preferences **and** `POWER.md` → Every session (the read command, first-session detection, watch mode values) |
| `references/cards.md`: rules for every card, passed, failed, didn't start, stopped early, possible product bug, saved test, suite (local and cloud grid) | `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Presenting results (rules + the five one-shot run cards) **and** `steering/kane-cli-testmd.md` → The saved test card **and** `steering/kane-cli-testrun.md` → Presenting results (suite card, failed-tests table, cloud grid rows) |
| `references/live-strip.md`: the live status strip (Claude Code only) | One sentence in `POWER.md` → Every session saying the strip is Claude Code only and not offered in Kiro. Do **not** document the strip commands in the power |
| `SKILL.md` §2 Decision tree | `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Decision tree, `steering/kane-cli-testmd.md` → When to recommend `testmd`, and `steering/kane-cli-assurance.md` for every test-case authoring ask |
| `SKILL.md` §3 Building a `run` command — flags, exit codes, examples, bare-objective guardrail, unresolved variables and the fill-before-any-run recipe | `POWER.md` → Command reference (condensed) **and** `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Full flag reference + Variables and secrets |
| `SKILL.md` §4 Writing objectives — three patterns, "store as", do/don't | `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Writing objectives — three patterns |
| `SKILL.md` §5 Parsing `--agent` output — essentials (includes `project_folder_auto_defaulted` in typed events) | `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Parsing the NDJSON output (Event types + Parsing strategy summary) |
| `SKILL.md` §6 Test cases from a description (no requirement document) | `POWER.md` → Overview (the third "way Kiro uses it") **and** `steering/kane-cli-testmd.md` → Authoring from a description **and** `steering/kane-cli-assurance.md` |
| `SKILL.md` §7 When to read which reference | Kiro analogue: `POWER.md`'s steering-file mapping (POWER.md tells Kiro when to load each steering file) |
| `references/objectives-cookbook.md` — analyze methods (Visual / Textual-DOM / URL / Title / DevTools→Network/Console/Performance/Cookies/localStorage), operators, chaining, pitfalls, worked examples | `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Analyze methods — picking the right checkpoint (plus the existing Combining patterns, Assertion specificity, and Do / Don't sections) |
| `references/testmd.md`: testmd file format, replay & cascade, `@import`, commands, parse errors, gate-fires-before-launch note, the saved-test stream table (`test_md_step_start` through `test_md_done`) | All of `steering/kane-cli-testmd.md` (the stream table lives under Replay policy and completion → The saved-test stream); authoring from a description points at the assurance steering |
| `references/parsing.md`: the 0.8.17+ stream contract (`stream_start`, `v`, `ts`, ignore unknown fields and event types, typeless step lines, completion event last, `events.ndjson` and the active-run pointer file), full NDJSON event schemas (`project_folder_auto_defaulted`, `bifurcation`, `child_agent_*`, `ask_user`, complete `run_end` fields incl. `credits_consumed`) | `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Parsing the NDJSON output (The stream contract + full event-type list + Terminal `run_end` event) |
| `references/test-manager.md`: project/folder agent surface (`projects list|create`, `folders list|create` with the **required** `--project <id>`, NDJSON wire shape, pagination), run-startup auto-default gate, `project_folder_auto_defaulted` event, self-healing for stale IDs, the global "changing where results go" flow | `POWER.md` → Step 3 (project/folder onboarding) **and** `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Browsing / creating projects and folders + The run-startup auto-default gate + Changing where results go **and** `steering/kane-cli-testmd.md` → Quick start (gate note) |
| `references/debug.md` — log layout, debugging flow, common failure patterns (incl. "did you mean" subcommand and self-healing rows), bug-report heuristic | `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Failure handling & log inspection + Bug-report heuristic |
| `references/parallel.md` — when to split, agent prompt template, batch summary | `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Parallel execution |
| `references/testrun.md`: batch runs: selection (paths/`--match`/`--tags`), preflight reasons, `--remote` (HyperExecute jobs, `remote_*` events, remote preflight codes, the 0.8.17+ remote additions), mobile members, `testrun_*` event schema (incl. `session_id`, `log_path`, `failure`, the authored member pair, `testrun_progress`), each test's own log and the `--stream-members` rule, suite card presentation, exit codes | All of `steering/kane-cli-testrun.md` |
| `references/evidence.md`: pack locations, the stderr view hint, `evidence serve/validate/merge`, debugging with a pack, the first-run rule (serve the pack and link the viewer instead of offering) | `steering/kane-cli-testrun.md` → Evidence packs **and** `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Failure handling (evidence-first flow) **and** `steering/kane-cli-first-run.md` → The first result |
| `references/setup-and-config.md` — install / auth / variables precedence / context files / config commands / Chrome management / directory layout | `POWER.md` → Onboarding (Steps 1–3) + `steering/kane-cli-run.md` → Variables and secrets + Context files + Configuration surface |
| `references/fair-evaluation.md` — like-for-like lifecycle comparison method, mandatory corrections (replay is zero-LLM, the "scripts already exist" sunk-cost trap, phase mismatch), maintenance-dominates-at-scale, what Kane CLI is purpose-built for | All of `steering/kane-cli-fair-evaluation.md` |
| `references/assurance.md` — the assurance journey (ingest/extract → review checkpoints → design → author → cover → reconcile), pause loop, trust rules, failure table | All of `steering/kane-cli-assurance.md` |
| `references/assurance-parsing.md` — the assurance NDJSON contract (`--mode agent` envelope, `done` guarantee, `session_paused` shapes, reconcile + coverage event families) | `steering/kane-cli-assurance.md` → the pause-loop and stream notes (condensed; the full schema stays canonical in the skill reference) |
| `references/mobile.md`: mobile availability (local = macOS Apple Silicon; cloud grid = any machine), the `--target` axis (desktop default / `emulator` = Android / `simulator` = iOS), `--device-name` / `--os-version` / `--app` selection, the required app-under-test formats, setup plus `doctor` / `devices list`, the flat `_test.md` `target:` + `app:` (+ `device_name:`/`os_version:`) keys, mobile members in `testrun` and `testrun run --remote`, and the web-only checkpoint carve-out | All of `steering/kane-cli-mobile.md` |

## Kiro-specific framing (don't lose these on edit)

The integration is not a verbatim copy of `SKILL.md`. It adds and preserves Kiro-specific framing:

1. **POWER.md frontmatter** — Kiro requires `name`, `displayName`, `description`, `keywords`, `author`. Keep them up to date and keep `keywords` broad enough to activate on user phrasing like "browser", "smoke test", "verify deploy".
2. **Onboarding is for Kiro to execute** — written as "Kiro runs this", not "user runs this". Only step back to the user when the action genuinely needs human input (credentials, project / folder IDs).
3. **Steering-file mapping in POWER.md** — POWER.md explicitly says when to load each steering file ("`kane-cli-run.md` for every `kane-cli run` invocation; `kane-cli-testmd.md` for any `_test.md` work"). Kiro's docs describe this as the way to scope steering content (see [kiro.dev/docs/powers/create](https://kiro.dev/docs/powers/create/)).
4. **Steering file naming** — `{tool}-{workflow}.md` (`kane-cli-run.md`, `kane-cli-testmd.md`). Avoid generic names like `steering.md`.
5. **No `inclusion:` frontmatter on in-power steering files.** That key is for `.kiro/steering/` workspace files, not steering files inside a power. POWER.md does the scoping.
6. **The "wait for `run_end`" rule** is restated prominently in `kane-cli-run.md` because the most common Kiro failure mode is the agent acting on partial output. Don't soften it.
7. **Internal field names are internal.** `run_end`, `final_state`, `session_dir`, `run_dir`, `NDJSON` — never expose these to the user. Translate them into plain language.
8. **Hook template ships in `hooks/`**, but the user must copy it to `.kiro/hooks/kane-verify.kiro.hook` in their own workspace. Powers don't install hooks for the user; the hook file in this repo is a template.
9. **The `# License and support` section in POWER.md.** Kiro's power review requires a body section whose heading contains "license", naming the underlying tool's license type (Apache-2.0) and carrying at least one support / contact link. It is **harness metadata — like the frontmatter — not a CLI fact**, so it has no `SKILL.md` source by design. Don't strip it during a mirroring pass, and don't backfill it into `SKILL.md`. Its links (LICENSE, GitHub Issues, Discord, `security@testmuai.com`, docs) are absolute URLs because the power is read outside a repo checkout; keep them in sync with the root `README.md` and `SECURITY.md`.

10. **The ready check runs commands, not a script.** The canonical skill runs `scripts/preflight.sh` from the skill folder. A Kiro power has no script path it can rely on, so the power describes the ready check as the fallback the canonical reference names (`kane-cli whoami`, `kane-cli balance`, `kane-cli config show`) plus the shell read of the saved preferences file. The card, the problems table, the sign-in rules and the no-human rule stay the same. Rows that only the script can fill (Chrome found, a running app port, the saved-test count) are left out rather than faked.
11. **Runtime tag is `kiro`, inline on every command.** `KANE_CLI_USER_AGENT=kiro` goes in front of each `kane-cli` command, because an `export` does not survive between shell calls. The same value is the host key in the saved preferences file. Examples in the power leave the prefix out for readability, and POWER.md Step 0 says so.
12. **The tour is verbatim.** The tour block in `steering/kane-cli-first-run.md` must stay word for word identical to the one in canonical `references/first-run.md`, doc links included. Re-copy it whenever the canonical text changes.
13. **No live strip in Kiro.** Kiro has no scriptable status line. POWER.md says in one sentence that the strip is Claude Code only and not offered. The only other trace is the `strip.<host>` key in the saved preferences schema, which Kiro preserves and never writes.

## Things to NOT put in the integration

The previous draft drifted from `SKILL.md` by inventing facts. Don't repeat these:

- ❌ **Version-specific release notes** (e.g. "What's new in 0.2.11"). `SKILL.md` doesn't reference a version; neither should we. Behavior we describe should hold across the supported range.
- ❌ **A multi-objective stdin / `/exit` session model for `kane-cli run`.** `SKILL.md` treats `kane-cli run` as single-shot — the process exits after `run_end`. Don't invent a stdin protocol.
- ❌ **"Project + folder mandatory or runs are blocked."** `SKILL.md` does not enforce this. Set them as a recommendation, not a hard mandate.
- ❌ **Made-up UI features** (floating in-browser badge, tabbed help, breadcrumbs, esc-to-default-pick, etc.). If `SKILL.md` doesn't mention it, don't claim it.
- ❌ **"The Playwright script is the deliverable."** `--code-export` is one optional flag. Don't pitch it as the primary purpose.
- ❌ **Standalone binary download URLs** that aren't documented in `SKILL.md`. They may or may not exist; don't guess.
- ❌ **A preflight script path, or the `strip enable|status|disable` commands.** The power does not ship the script, and the live strip is Claude Code only.
- ❌ **Probe commands the canonical files do not name** (for Chrome, a running dev server, CI or SSH detection). The canonical script does those checks internally; the power must not invent shell equivalents.
- ❌ **"Export `KANE_CLI_USER_AGENT` once per session"** or **asking for an access key or password in chat.** Both were in earlier drafts and both are wrong now.

When in doubt: **say only what `SKILL.md` says.**

## Update workflow

### When `SKILL.md` changes

1. **Read the diff.** Look at the section headings in the mapping table above to see which Kiro files might need to move.
2. **Update `POWER.md` first** if the change touches anything in the condensed command reference, onboarding, or steering-file mapping.
3. **Update the matching steering file(s)** if the change touches details (objective patterns, flags, NDJSON schema, parse errors, etc.).
4. **Update the hook template** only if the recommended one-shot smoke-test command shape changed.
5. **Run the verification checklist below.**
6. **Commit with a message that names the upstream change**, e.g. `kiro-powers: mirror SKILL.md update for new --foo flag`.

### When the Kiro Powers spec changes

If [kiro.dev/docs/powers/create](https://kiro.dev/docs/powers/create/) changes the required frontmatter, directory layout, or steering-file convention, update the integration to match:

1. Re-read the spec and the official example powers at https://github.com/kirodotdev/powers.
2. Update the frontmatter in `POWER.md` to match new required keys.
3. Rename / restructure files if the convention changed.
4. Update this doc to reflect the new spec.

### When adding a new flag or command to `kane-cli`

1. Add it to `SKILL.md` first.
2. Add it to the condensed flag table in `POWER.md` if it's commonly used; otherwise just to the full flag table in the relevant steering file.
3. Add an example showing the flag in context.
4. Update the verification checklist if the flag changes recommended defaults.

## Verification checklist

Before committing changes to the integration:

- [ ] POWER.md frontmatter has all required keys: `name`, `displayName`, `description`, `keywords`, `author`.
- [ ] `keywords` still activates on common user phrasing (browser, smoke test, deploy, verify, e2e, ui).
- [ ] Every fact in POWER.md / steering / hook can be traced back to a line in `SKILL.md`.
- [ ] Onboarding steps still produce the target end state (`kane-cli --version`, `kane-cli whoami`, `kane-cli config show`).
- [ ] Steering files are named `kane-cli-run.md` / `kane-cli-testmd.md` (Kiro convention `{tool}-{workflow}.md`).
- [ ] Steering files do **not** have `inclusion:` frontmatter (that's for workspace `.kiro/steering/` files, not in-power steering).
- [ ] POWER.md explicitly tells Kiro when to load each steering file.
- [ ] POWER.md has a `# License and support` section naming Apache-2.0 and at least one support link (see Kiro-specific framing #9 — required by power review, has no `SKILL.md` source).
- [ ] The "wait for `run_end`" rule still appears prominently in `kane-cli-run.md`.
- [ ] POWER.md still opens every session with the ready check (three commands plus the saved preferences read), never claims a preflight script, and tags commands inline with `KANE_CLI_USER_AGENT=kiro` (no `export`).
- [ ] The tour block in `steering/kane-cli-first-run.md` is identical, word for word, to the one in canonical `references/first-run.md`.
- [ ] No text asks the user for an access key or password in chat, and nothing shows the `Expires` line from `whoami`.
- [ ] Every `folders list` / `folders create` example carries `--project <id>`, and the `run_end` credits field is `credits_consumed`.
- [ ] The live strip appears only as the one "Claude Code only" sentence (plus the preserved `strip` key in the preferences schema).
- [ ] No internal field names (`run_end`, `final_state`, `session_dir`, `run_dir`, `NDJSON`) appear in user-facing message templates.
- [ ] No fabricated facts: no version-specific release notes, no stdin / `/exit` protocol, no made-up UI features, no unverified download URLs.
- [ ] Hook template (`hooks/kane-verify.kiro.hook`) still parses as valid JSON.

## Testing the power locally

To dogfood changes in a real Kiro install before publishing:

1. Open Kiro → Powers panel → **Add power from Local Path**.
2. Point it at `integrations/kiro-powers/`.
3. Activate the power by mentioning one of the keywords ("browser", "kane-cli", "smoke test", etc.).
4. Confirm Kiro loaded `POWER.md` and the right steering file for the conversation.
5. Run a real command end to end — the simplest smoke test is `kane-cli run "Go to https://example.com, store the page title as 'title'" --agent`.

If the power loaded but the agent hallucinated commands or flags that aren't in `SKILL.md`, the steering file is the wrong size — either too long (Kiro skipped past it) or contradicts itself. Tighten and re-test.
