# Running tests

kane-cli runs tests in two modes: an interactive **TUI** for development and exploration, and a headless **CLI** for scripts and CI. Both modes execute the same agent against the same browser; only the surface differs.

## Writing objectives

An objective is the natural-language instruction the agent follows. The clearer the objective, the more reliably the agent completes it.

What makes a good objective:

- **Specific.** Name the site, the action, and the field values where they matter.
- **Action-oriented.** Lead with a verb: search, open, fill, click, verify.
- **Ends in a check of the result.** State what "done" looks like as a claim about the page, so the agent knows when to stop and a replay has something to verify.

Two habits make an objective reliable enough to save and replay.

**End every flow in a check of the result.** Close with an assertion about the resulting page state — `verify the cart shows 1 item` — not a bare `submit` or `confirm the dialog`. Without a closing check, "done" only means the agent believed it finished; with one, the run passes or fails on the real end state. Name the outcome, never the control that triggered it: `verify the Submit button is visible` fails exactly when the action worked, because the button disappears on success. If an objective has several phases (log in, then search, then check out), each phase ends in its own check.

**Say the goal, not the clicks.** Phrase actions as goals — `Log in as {{tester}}`, `Complete checkout with the saved card` — so a run absorbs a reordered form or a new popup instead of breaking on it. Keep exact values such as credentials, prices, and URLs literal or in `{{variables}}`. For a step that only sometimes appears, such as a cookie banner, write it as a condition (`if a cookie banner appears, dismiss it`) rather than assuming it away.

### Examples

```text
Search for "noise-cancelling headphones" on amazon.com and confirm at least
one result appears with a price under $200.
```

```text
Fill the registration form at example.com/signup with name "Test User",
email "test@example.com", and a 12-character random password. Submit and
verify the confirmation page loads.
```

```text
Open https://app.example.com, log in with the credentials in {{tester}},
navigate to Settings > Billing, and verify the current plan is "Pro".
```

```text
Open https://app.example.com, set a cookie named session with value
{{auth_token}}, reload, and verify the dashboard loads. Then click the
"Copy invite link" button and verify the clipboard contains "/invite/".
```

Objectives can also set, delete, and clear cookies, localStorage, and the
test clipboard directly — see [Browser State Actions](./features/browser-state.md).

Objectives can also make API calls directly — POST/GET a URL or paste a `curl`,
save the response, and assert on it — see [API Calls](./features/api-calls.md).

### Bad to better

| | Objective |
|---|---|
| Bad | Test the login page. |
| Better | Open https://app.example.com/login, log in as `{{tester}}`, and verify the dashboard URL contains `/home`. |

The bad version leaves "test" undefined and gives the agent no end state. The better version names the URL, the credentials, and the assertion that closes the loop.

## Interactive TUI

Launch the TUI by running `kane-cli --tui`. The TUI is the right surface when you are exploring objectives, debugging failures, or working through a multi-run flow that should share browser state.

### Boot and menu

On launch, kane-cli runs a short boot sequence (auth check, environment resolution, mascot animation), then drops into the **main menu**. The top-level entries are:

| Entry | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Run | Start a run or adjust per-run options. |
| Auth | Login, logout, switch profile, view identity, check credit balance. |
| Config | View and change settings (mode, project, folder, Chrome profile, window size). |
| Exit | Graceful shutdown (uploads the session if applicable). |

Use the arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select, and Esc to back out of a submenu.

### Chat

Selecting **Run > Start Run** switches the TUI into chat mode. Type your objective at the prompt and press Enter. The agent begins streaming steps into the scrollback as it works: each step shows the action taken, a short rationale, and a status icon. When the run finishes, a result summary block appears.

Subsequent runs in the same TUI session reuse the same browser, so you can iterate on objectives without re-logging in or re-navigating.

### Slash commands

Typing `/` in chat mode opens an autocomplete palette. Continue typing to filter, use the arrow keys to select, and press Enter to insert the command. The full command list:

| Command | Args | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `/run` | `"objective"` | Execute a test run. |
| `/login` | `[--profile name]` | OAuth login. |
| `/logout` | `[--profile name]` | Logout and revoke tokens. |
| `/whoami` | `[--profile name]` | Show profile info. |
| `/balance` | | Show credit balance. |
| `/profiles` | `list\|switch\|delete` | Manage profiles. |
| `/config` | `show\|set-window\|set-url\|set-mode\|chrome-profile\|project\|folder` | Manage configuration. |
| `/mobile` | | Switch the session to an emulator or simulator. |
| `/desktop` | | Switch the session back to Desktop (Chrome). |
| `/doctor` | | Check mobile tooling & devices. |
| `/new` | | Start a fresh session (uploads the current session and seals its evidence pack first). |
| `/summary` | `[index]` | View detailed run summaries. |
| `/cancel` | | Abort the current run. |
| `/help` | | Show the command reference. |
| `/clear` | | Clear chat history. |
| `/exit` | | Quit kane-cli. |

You can also send a bare line of text without a leading `/`. It is treated as the objective for `/run`.

### History search

Press **Ctrl+R** in the input prompt to open reverse history search across past inputs in this and previous sessions. Type to filter, use the arrow keys to move between matches, Enter to accept, and Esc to dismiss.

The same prompt also offers ghost-text completion: if your current input is a prefix of a recent entry or a slash command, the rest is shown dimmed and Tab accepts it.

### Status bar

A two-row status bar sits at the bottom of the TUI. It shows:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Model | The model in use (default `v16-alpha`). |
| Session | Last six characters of the current session ID. |
| Auth dot | Green when authenticated, red when not logged in. |
| Profile | Active profile name (or `no profile`). |
| Environment | `prod` (green) or a yellow `stage` warning. |
| Runs | Number of runs completed in this session. |
| Hint line | Context-aware shortcuts (chat: `ctrl+c cancel/exit`; menu: `↑↓ navigate ↵ select esc back`). |

### Cancelling and exiting

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Cancel the current run | `/cancel`, or **Ctrl+C** once during a run. |
| Exit the TUI | `/exit`, or **Ctrl+C** twice in quick succession. |
| Force exit during shutdown upload | **Ctrl+C** twice while exit is in progress. |

A graceful `/exit` runs the upload pipeline (if applicable), seals the session's [evidence pack](./evidence.md), offers to open it in the browser viewer, and prints any final links to your terminal scrollback before the process ends.

### Multi-run sessions

Every run launched from the same TUI invocation shares one Chrome instance and one session directory. Cookies, login state, and tabs persist across runs in that session, so an early run can log in and a later run can land mid-application without re-authenticating. Starting a fresh session from inside the TUI is done with `/new`, which uploads the current session and then resets state.

### Interactive follow-ups

If the agent needs information mid-run (for example, a one-time code or a clarifying choice), it pauses and asks at the input prompt. Type your answer and press Enter; the agent resumes from where it left off. Use Ctrl+C to cancel the run instead of answering.

## Command-line mode

`kane-cli run` is the headless surface. It is the right choice for CI jobs, scripted invocations, and any environment that has no interactive TTY. Progress streams to stderr; the final JSON result is written to stdout.

### Basic invocation

A minimal run:

```bash
kane-cli run "Search for 'noise-cancelling headphones' on amazon.com"
```

A longer invocation with options:

```bash
kane-cli run "Log in as {{tester}} and verify the dashboard loads" \
  --headless \
  --max-steps 40 \
  --timeout 300 \
  --variables-file ./vars.json
```

### Run options

The customer-facing flags accepted by `kane-cli run`:

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--headless` | Run Chrome in headless mode. | Off |
| `--max-steps <n>` | Maximum agent steps. | `30` |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | Kill the run after N seconds. | None |
| `--url <url>` | Start URL for the run. Overrides the configured `default_url`; bare domains are normalized to `https://`. See [Default start URL](./configuration.md#default-start-url). | Config `default_url` |
| `--allow-missing-url` | Non-TTY only: proceed from the browser's current page instead of failing when no start URL resolves (a provided `--url` is still used). | Off |
| `--cdp-endpoint <url>` | Connect to an existing Chrome via CDP. | None |
| `--ws-endpoint <url>` | Connect to a Playwright WebSocket endpoint (e.g. TestmuAI `wss://`). | None |
| `--global-context <file>` | Override the global context Markdown file. | `~/.testmuai/kaneai/global-memory.md` |
| `--local-context <file>` | Override the local context Markdown file. | `<cwd>/.testmuai/context.md` |
| `--variables <json>` | Inline variables JSON. | None |
| `--variables-file <path>` | Load variables from a JSON file. | None |
| `--session-context <json>` | Prior runs context JSON. | None |
| `--username <user>` | Basic auth username (skip OAuth). | None |
| `--access-key <key>` | Basic auth access key (skip OAuth). | None |
| `--env <name>` | Environment (`prod`). | Active profile's env |
| `--mode <name>` | Run mode: `action` (strict) or `testing` (lenient). | Config value, otherwise `testing` |
| `--bug-detection <mode>` | Detect product bugs while authoring: `off`, `stop` (halt the run on a confirmed bug), or `continue` (record it and keep going). Overrides `config set-bug-detection`. See [Configuration](./configuration.md#bug-detection). | Config value, otherwise `off` |
| `--agent` | Plain NDJSON output, no colors or UI. | Off |
| `--code-export` | Generate code export after upload. | Off |
| `--code-language <lang>` | Code export language (currently `python`). | `python` |
| `--skip-code-validation` | Skip post-codegen worker-side validation. | On |
| `--no-skip-code-validation` | Force post-codegen worker-side validation. | Off |

### Unresolved variables

Every `{{name}}` in the objective is checked before the run starts. A name with no value is a **warning, never a refusal** — the run proceeds and the name is typed as written unless a step sets it first. On a TTY the warning is the receipt shown in [Variables and context](./variables-and-context.md#before-a-run-unresolved-variables); with `--agent` it is a single typed event before the first progress frame:

```json
{"type":"warning","code":"unresolved_variables","message":"2 variable(s) have no value — typed as written unless a step sets them first","suggested_file":".testmuai/variables/variables.json","variables":[{"name":"checkout_url","reason":"not_declared","used_by":[{"file":"objective","step":1}]},{"name":"login_password","reason":"value_missing","file":".testmuai/variables/variables.json","used_by":[{"file":"objective","step":1}]}]}
```

`reason` is `value_missing` (the key exists in `file`, with no value) or `not_declared` (the key is in no file; `suggested_file` is where to add it). Exit codes are unaffected. An explicit `{{global.*}}` reference (resolved from Test Manager at run time), names an earlier step stores, and the `{{smart.*}}` / `{{environment.*}}` / `{{secrets.*}}` / `{{totp.*}}` namespaces are never checked.

For variables and context file behavior, see [./variables-and-context.md](./variables-and-context.md). For code export and the run mode toggle, see [./configuration.md](./configuration.md).

### Mobile runs

By default a run targets the **desktop** browser (Chrome), so every example above is unchanged. On macOS Apple Silicon you can instead point a run at a virtual mobile device: an `emulator` (a virtual Android device) or a `simulator` (a virtual iOS device). Every mobile run needs an app under test.

```bash
# desktop (default): nothing changes for web runs
kane-cli run "Search for 'noise-cancelling headphones' on amazon.com"

# emulator (Android): install an .apk build and run against it
kane-cli run "Add the first item to the cart" --target emulator --app ./builds/app-debug.apk

# simulator (iOS): install a .zip build and run against it
kane-cli run "Sign in and open the account tab" --target simulator --app ./builds/MyApp.zip
```

The mobile run flags:

- `--target desktop|emulator|simulator`: which target to run against. Defaults to the saved session target, otherwise `desktop`.
- `--device <id>`: pick a device by name, serial, `ip:port`, or udid. In the TUI/TTY, omitting it opens a one-time picker and the choice is saved; in non-interactive runs a device must already be set (via `--device` or `kane-cli config set-device`) or the run exits with the fix spelled out.
- `--app <path|APPid>`: the app under test, required for every mobile run. Pass a build (emulator: `.apk`, simulator: `.zip`) or an uploaded app id (`APP` followed by six or more digits). On the `desktop` target, `--device` and `--app` are ignored.

In the interactive TUI, a first run offers a Desktop / Emulator / Simulator chooser, and you can switch targets at any time with `/mobile` and `/desktop`. Run `/doctor` to check mobile tooling and devices.

For setup (Xcode or Android Studio, `kane-cli login`, and `kane-cli doctor --install`) and the app formats each target accepts, see [Mobile testing](./mobile/overview.md).

### Output streams

| Stream | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| stderr | Live progress (banner, step tree, result box, links, upload progress, feedback prompt). |
| stdout | The final JSON `run_end` payload, including the share URL when an upload succeeds. |

This separation lets you capture each independently:

```bash
kane-cli run "..." > result.json 2> progress.log
```

In CI, redirect stdout to a file your job can parse and let stderr stream to the build log so engineers can read the run in real time.

When stdin is not a TTY, kane-cli automatically switches to plain NDJSON mode (the same as `--agent`). Each line on stdout is one JSON event terminated by a newline.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Run passed. |
| `1` | Run failed (agent reached an unrecoverable failure or upload failed). |
| `2` | Error (auth, TMS credential exchange, configuration, Chrome, unknown subcommand, or unhandled exception). |
| `3` | Run was cancelled or hit the `--timeout`. |

Use these codes to gate downstream CI steps.

## What you see at the end of a run

When a run finishes, kane-cli prints a result summary to the terminal:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Status | `PASSED` (green check) or `FAILED` (red cross). |
| Steps | Total step count, with a `(N passed, M failed)` breakdown when there were failures. |
| Duration | Wall-clock time in seconds (or minutes and seconds for longer runs). |
| Credits | Credits consumed, when reported. |
| Summary | Bullet-point summary of what the agent did. |
| Reason | Failure reason (failed runs only). |

Below the summary, kane-cli prints any of the following links that apply to the run:

| Label | Points to |
|-------|-----------|
| `ShareLink` | A shareable session URL on TestmuAI TMS. |
| `TestCase` | The test case detail page in TestmuAI TMS. |
| `CodeExport` | The local directory containing the generated code (when code export is enabled). |

Modern terminals render these as clickable hyperlinks. For details on what each link leads to, see [./test-manager-integration.md](./test-manager-integration.md).

The run is also captured as a sealed [evidence pack](./evidence.md) — screenshots, per-step console/network logs, and failure records. In a terminal, kane-cli offers to open it in the browser viewer; in agent or non-interactive runs it prints a one-line `evidence: view locally with …` hint to stderr instead.

## Feedback prompt

After the result and links print, kane-cli prompts you to rate the session with thumbs up or thumbs down. Use the left and right arrow keys to choose, Enter to submit, or Esc to skip. The rating is sent to TestmuAI TMS for the active test case; see [./test-manager-integration.md](./test-manager-integration.md) for what is recorded.
